# Advent of Code 2023
This repo contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/) in Python.  

## Days completed
- Day 1: ```december_1.py ``` ✔️
- Day 2: ```december_2.py ``` ✔️
- Day 3: ```december_3.py ``` ✔️
- Day 4: ```december_4.py ``` ✔️
- Day 5: ```december_5.py ``` ✔️
    - Should try another approach to part 2 as it is very slow
- Day 6: ```december_6.py ``` 

## How to run
Just call the python file from the day folder you want to run. For example:

```python
python3 december_1/december_1.py
```
